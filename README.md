# 6 Dimensional Rotation Matrix Parameterisation in NumPy
I just wanted to check that I had a correct numpy implementation of Yi Zhou's 6 dimensional rotation matrix parameterization. 

This is based on the this [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1812.07035), and the implementation [here](https://github.com/papagina/RotationContinuity/blob/758b0ce551c06372cab7022d4c0bdf331c89c696/sanity_test/code/tools.py#L47).
